I'm passionate about empowering others to make a difference and believe that work done with excellence can make a tangible impact on the lives of others. I thrive on finding solutions to problems and creating efficient workflows. Embracing challenges, learning relentlessly, and pursuing innovation have fueled my professional goals. I have diverse experience in retail, sales, operations, CRM databases, and management. In addition to strong verbal and written communication skills, I also have the ability to manage multiple priorities in a changing environment. <br />
